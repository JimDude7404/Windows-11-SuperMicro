# Windows-11-SuperMicro
This is a custom build of Windows 11 for legacy devices and is super small. The final install size is 11gb. 

# Installation

You can upgrade to Windows 11 via setup.exe something other .iso's cannout use.

I have reworked setup.exe to install Windows 11. This includes upgrading and keeping files.

You can follow Microsoft's official install guide.

Setup.exe will call itself Windows 10 but its actually Windows 11
